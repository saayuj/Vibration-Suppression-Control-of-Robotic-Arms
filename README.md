This repository contains the work performed during an internship under the Mitacs Gloablink Research Internship program. I worked with Prof Ishwar Singh (McMaster University) and a robotics startup, AXIBO on Vibration Suppression Control of Robotic Arms.

For a quick overview of the project, the presentation "**SLP Presentation.pdf**" can be viewed. [Contribution guidelines for this project](Vibration-Suppression-Control-of-Robotic-Arms/SLP Presentation.pdf)

The final report "**MITACS Project Documentation - Saayuj Deshpande.pdf**" can be used as a guideline for the sequential work done during this project. The report references various simulink (.slx) and python (.py) files which are uploaded too.

The research papers studied were:
- Xian Zhang, Tao Tao, Gedong Jiang, Xuesong Mei, and Chuang Zou, "**A Refined Dynamic Model of Harmonic Drive and Its Dynamic Response Analysis**."
- Makoto Iwasaki, Hiroyuki Nakamura, "**Vibration Suppression for Angular Transmission Errors in Harmonic Drive Gearings and Application to Industrial Robots**."
- Dan Kielsholm Thomsen, Rune SÃ¸e-Knudsen, Ole Balling, Xuping Zhang, "**Vibration control of industrial robot arms by multi-mode time-varying input shaping**."
