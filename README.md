## Introduction
This repository contains the work performed during an internship under the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship program. I worked with Prof Ishwar Singh (McMaster University) and a robotics startup, AXIBO on Vibration Suppression Control of Robotic Arms.

## Guide
- For a quick overview of the project, the presentation [**SLP Presentation.pdf**](https://github.com/saayuj/Vibration-Suppression-Control-of-Robotic-Arms/blob/main/SLP%20Presentation.pdf) can be viewed.
- The final report [**MITACS Project Documentation - Saayuj Deshpande.pdf**](https://github.com/saayuj/Vibration-Suppression-Control-of-Robotic-Arms/blob/main/MITACS%20Project%20Documentation%20-%20Saayuj%20Deshpande.pdf) can be used as a guideline for the sequential work done during this project. The report references various simulink (.slx) and python (.py) files which are uploaded in the respective sections.
